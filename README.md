# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

**bin/setup** script to setup the project on local (including  ‘bundle install’, database setup, ‘yarn/npm install’)

**bin/dev** script to run the server (runs rails & react server & also mailcatcher)

**Mailcather**
Along with **localhost:3000** in browser, also open **localhost:1080** (can view mails in localhost development)
